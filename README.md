# Members Only

## About

Members Only is a simple Rails application that relies on authentication with Devise to create and view posts. Non-members are able to read posts but only members can see who wrote a post and create posts themselves.

The application is part of The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com).
